A shining star, I am
Destructible
Born to die!
With no hope.
Dreams of light.
Reading chines wisdom books
Trying Arabs strange healing ways
All the Assyrian heroic stories
I lived, for immortality leaves
I searched, with Gilgamesh
But I am still falling apart
Ask the moon about my night
The sun for my days!
Night, Night,
Fragments of light
People tend to love
Things that are bright.
No one hears what I say
And no one believes that...
I was born dead.
