Quite
Setting on the stairs
"Good boy"
They thought,
Faces full of glares
No words,
No moves,
Empty jars
Empty imaginary loaves
How could one talk?
How could one move?
A patience of survival
pain worn as gloves
Jealousy, 
Envy,
Feelings that can make grooves
Hungry, hungry
For an embrace
A touch
Or even a bruise,
But I guess everyone was
Pretending not to notice
For in such times
Feeling become loose
