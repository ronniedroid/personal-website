A broken Mirror I am
Unrecoverable
Giving reflection of the past
In memories I live
If you just look
A plastic art
An unfinished image, I am
Over colored
With deep scars
Giving me a look of smile
An endless composition
Of music, Dark
A piano of half tunes
That is me
Hear me, I am soft
You will get (relaxed)
Will not realize
My broken notes of the past
