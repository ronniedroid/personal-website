If I were a shoe
Every day I would be
Looked at once or twice,
Cleaned and polished,
No matter when or who.

I would serve quietly,
Praised for my quality,
Loved for looking like that
Or for what I could do.

I would have adventures
In my lifeâ€”
Mud, dirt, parties, and woo!

I would be weaponized,
Sexualized,
In moments that lead to "Oh!"

I might even be famous,
But most importantly,
I wouldn't feel a thing...
I guess I'd love to be
A shoe.
