I lived, and lived
For twenty five years
I thought I did
I died
It hurt
Then I realized
I'm not dead
Because it shouldn't hurt
Then I was hurt
Then I was killed
And yet I lived
To my surprise
After all
I had lift
I had yet to lift
Your body
And I died
Again
This time in beauty
And pain
It hurt?
Yes it did
But,
I also felt!
I owned a piece
Of my life
When an
Unfurling fragrance
I became
And all my tricks, I spilled
I was in love
I was alive
Inhaled and inhaled
I started to melt
Until I was empty
And empty
I was
Left.
